    "__Objective:__ Compute the correlation between human judgement and traditional metrics (e.g. BLEU and METEOR,etc.) compare it to the correlation between human judgement and embedding-based metrics (e.g., BERTScore, CLIPScore, etc.). Optional: If time permits, compute correlation between human judgement and the visual attention map alignment, then compare against traditional and embedding-based metrics.\n",
