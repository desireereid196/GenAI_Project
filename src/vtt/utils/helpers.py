helpers.py

Utility functions for environment and runtime setup across the project.

This module includes tools for detecting available hardware (GPU or CPU)
and configuring TensorFlow's memory usage behavior accordingly.

Functionality:
    - Detects if TensorFlow was built with CUDA GPU support.
    - Enables memory growth to prevent full preallocation of GPU memory.
    - Fallbacks safely to CPU if no GPU is available or setup fails.

    Detect and configure TensorFlow device (GPU or CPU).

    This function checks if TensorFlow has been built with CUDA support
    and whether a GPU device is available. If a GPU is found, it attempts
    to enable memory growth to allow TensorFlow to allocate GPU memory on demand
    instead of reserving all memory at once.

    Returns:
        str: Either 'GPU' if a GPU was successfully detected and configured,
             or 'CPU' if no GPU was found or configuration failed.
